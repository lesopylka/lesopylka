## I'm a student

-  I'm in search of good people to talk about everything(in particular about programming)
-  I really like to study and to learn something interesting, and I don't miss a single chance to do it
-  Some useless fact about me: I'm a little lazy
-  My idol is [sakost](https://github.com/sakost)
-  I am currently studying gamedev and I really like it.
